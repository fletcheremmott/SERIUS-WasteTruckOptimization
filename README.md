# SERIUS 2025 - Waste Truck Optimization
National University of Singapore - Fletcher Emmott

The "Project Files" folder contains all the files required to run the Genetic Algorithm. Adapted from the PyGAD framework https://github.com/ahmedfgad/GeneticAlgorithmPython
The "testAPI" folder contains test API calls to the weather service (data.gov.sg) and the traffic service (datamall.lta.gov.sg). The traffic service requires registering with the LTA for an API key however using Postman does not require you to register to access the API
